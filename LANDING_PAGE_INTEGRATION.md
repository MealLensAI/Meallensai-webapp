# Landing Page Integration

## Overview
The landing page has been successfully integrated as the main entry point of the MealLensAI application. Users now start at the landing page and can navigate to the main app after authentication.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Landing Page Component
- Created `src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` - A React component that replicates the original HTML landing page
- Added `src/pages/LandingPage.css` - Custom styles for the landing page
- Features include:
  - Responsive design with mobile menu
  - Auto-advancing feature carousel
  - Smooth scrolling navigation
  - Authentication-aware UI (shows different buttons for logged-in vs logged-out users)

### 2. Updated Routing
- Modified `src/App.tsx` to make the landing page the root route (`/`)
- Changed the main app route to `/app` (previously `/`)
- Updated `ProtectedRoute` to redirect unauthenticated users to the landing page instead of login

### 3. Authentication Flow Updates
- Updated `src/pages/Login.tsx` and `src/pages/Signup.tsx` to redirect to `/app` after successful authentication
- Modified `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` to redirect to `/` (landing page) for unauthenticated users

### 4. Navigation Flow
```
Landing Page (/) 
├── Logged Out Users:
│   ├── "Try MealLensAI Now" → Signup page
│   ├── "Log In" → Login page
│   └── "Sign Up" → Signup page
└── Logged In Users:
    ├── "Try MealLensAI Now" → Main app (/app)
    └── "Go to App" → Main app (/app)
```

│   ├── LandingPage.css      # Landing page styles
│   ├── Login.tsx           # Updated redirects
│   └── Signup.tsx          # Updated redirects
├── components/

## Assets
- All required assets are already in `public/assets/`
- Video file: `public/assets/okay.mp4`
- Images: `public/assets/images/`
- Logo: `public/assets/images/logo.svg`

## Usage

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will start at `http://localhost:5173` and show the landing page.

### Production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the authentication flow thoroughly
2. Ensure all assets are loading correctly
3. Test mobile responsiveness
4. Consider adding analytics tracking to the landing page
5. Implement the donate functionality if needed

## Notes
- The landing page maintains the same visual design as the original HTML version
- All interactive elements are now React components
- The authentication state is properly managed through the existing auth context
- Mobile menu provides full navigation on smaller screens
